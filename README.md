## What is Friend Finder?
Friend Finder is a web application where a user answers a 10 question survey on a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The user's answers will be compared to answers from other, previous users to find the person whose answers most closely match their own. The top match will be displayed in a modal as the user's new best friend! The modal includes the name of the user's best match and photo of the best match (if the match provided a link to an image). The user's information is stored in Friend Finder so they might be found by future users of Friend Finder.
